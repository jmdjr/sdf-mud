I wish I could remember the format we used to use, it was nice. It doesn't
matter though. Just note the functions and files you edited, and what your
changes did. Comments in the code are always good too.

Added do_trance, ruminate and meditate to skills.c. Also added a ! to do_group 
(act_comm.c) to make it so mana is actually displayed
-Andy November 2, 2008

Fixed mud.h's dice_parse function's parameter name. Was 'exp', now it's 'exp2'.
This should prevent the name comflict with math.h's exp function, or whatever
it was. I still don't know how math.h is bring included.
-Batman November 2, 2008

Fixed skills.c's tumbling function. It now does not call chance to check if
your align agrees with your clan's align.
-Batman November 2, 2008

Finished up on ruminate, trance and meditate in skills.c. Also did what was
needed to add gsns for all of them. I did a tiny change to do_peace in
act_wiz.c, too.
-Andy November 4, 2008

Fixed the sys_bugs argument in do_fshow (act_wiz.c) and added last_bugs 
argument.
-Andy November 5, 2008

Fixed the issue with any class/race being able to Mistwalk.
-Tron November 6, 2008

Fixed fshow helps, and updated fshow clear in the function do_fshow and
do_fclear (both in act_wiz.c) and updated mud.h with a definition for
NOHELP_FILE. Also edited act_info.c so as to log to system/nohelp.txt
when soembody tries to access a non-existant help file.
-Andy November 7, 2008 

Created do_visogy function. The problem with it was, I think, that it was 
a skill, and the code was set up to treat it as a spell. Files edited: 
do.c, skills.c
-Andy November 8, 2008

Fixed a Memory leak with clean_obj_queue. It was supposed to clean up 
the memory of an extracted object.
-Tron November 9th, 2008

Uncommented four lines in update.  related to bloodthirst.  
I'm not sure why they were commented out in the first place, but it
is part of the function that magic.c (gain_condition) to update blood
values, and contains a function that gain_condition is calling to perform
a full update.  Still trying to trace all the connections to determine 
why a successful (or unsuccessful) spell doesn't alter blood points.
-Mordred November 14, 2008

Commented out a call to nice() in pfiles.c. Would set priority to 20 (lowest) 
when pfiles were scanned.
-Marten November 15th, 2008

Made it so that balzhur, destroy and suicide delete lockers in their 
respective functions.. act_wiz.c, suicide.c
-Andy November 16, 2008

Changed do_meditate in skills.c so that NPCs can't use it. They don't need 
it, and it was crashing the MDU.
-Andy November 17, 2008

Fixed do_loadup in act_wiz.c so that the MUD doesn't crash when you loadup a
non-existant character.
-Andy November 18, 2008

Fixed the blood problem (not losing it), function gain_condition in 
update.c
-Reaper November 18, 2008

Changed recall to only work for levels 0-25 and >= 100 skils.c 
function do_recall
-Andy November 18, 2008

Fixed Bleeding so you bleed normally now. It was multiplying the bleed in mud_comm.c
by 3 per hit and tick.
-Jade Dec 5, 2008

Fixed balzhur in act_wiz.c so that it removes your remort levels. Also fixed a 
bug that i created in balzhur where it deletes the balzhur-er's locker instead 
of the balzhur-ee's locker. Also aded a call to the system() function to 
act_move.cto copy player files to /player/dt/Playername after hitting a DT
-Andy Monday, December 8, 2008

Fixed mset pkill. Took out scion's version and replaced it with the one that he
had commented out. WOrks fine now :) 
-Andy Monday, December something, 2008

[Bug Fix]
Fixed sneak command. Added do_sneak to do.c
-Xion Dec 20, 2008 

[Feature addition: trainer flag]
Fixed Truhuga. Added special act flag spec_trainer for trainer.
Now trainers cannot be killed.
Fleeing donot cause exp loss.
spec_trainer can be added to any mobile.
-Xion Dec 22, 2008.

[Bug Fix]
Fixed "sacrifice all" fucntion. Bug raised by Hasjman.
Code changes in act_obj.c. Function do_sacrifice and sac_obj.
-Xion Dec 26, 2008.

[Bug Fix]
Fixed incorrect printing of shop list by switching variables
in shops.c
-Mordred December 28, 2008

[Bug Fix]
Swapped int and wiz in the do_reroll function of player.c

Fixed the nested rat by adding a string compare of the first 3 char of the "argument" string.
-Sywin December 29, 2008

Added some level checks to check_illegal_pk in fight.c to account for
remort levels.
-Andy December 29, 2008

Did some work false criticals in fight.c Added a bool variable victim_damaged, used as check for AC hit or not.
Still needs work, doesn't quite work yet.
-Sywin December 29, 2008


Added a workaround to criticals so that if damage = 0 or less damage is then set to 1 to prevent a critical
from deal no damage at all.
-Sywin December 29, 2008

Reworked the if statements in is_legal_kill function in skills.c (start line 150 or so) to avoid what appeared
to be an incorrect return of TRUE automatically.  Seemed to be the problem for hitall, but didn't seem to fix
the problem (it appears that it is attacking all players because is_legal_kill is always evaluating TRUE).
i left my changes in there, but it still should be reviewed, since obviously it's still not working.
-Mordred January 2, 2009

Uncommented correct macro for IS_PKILL in mud.h - fixing hitall problem.
-Mordred January 2, 2009

Changed wimpy for mobs to start fleeing at 25% fight.c
-Andy January 3, 2009

Changed can_astral to be a bit less restrictive by commenting out osme of the ifchecks.
-Andy Jan 4, 2009

Changed do_who in act_info.c, with the help of reaper, to display idle times for
people who are away. Like this: [AWAY:420]
-Andy January 5, 2009

Added get_adept_remort() to the end of remort.c. This should fix the problem
where you adept skills at the percentage of your last remort. I also changed
all references to the now old GET_ADEPT to work with this new function.
-Andy January 5, 2009

Fixed bug in in_comma where the the most significant group had only two digits.
-Benjamin Newman (Fallon) January 5, 2009

Changed portal so you can portal to prototype and norecall rooms. Lots of rooms
have prototype flags leftover from building, and I don't know why norecall was in
there to begin with... Isn't that what the noastral flag is for?
-Andy January 6, 2009


Fixed a typo hompage/homepage in act_info.c
-Marten January 10, 2009

Fixed the critical hit bug, I hope. Moved just moved an ifcheck. You can see
it's origional position, I just commented it out. This was in fight.c (I think)
I also added spell_custos_angelus to magic.c
-Andy February 20, 2009

-Added lines in db.c for sixth_attack, seventh_attack, and eighth_attack
Haven't figured out if that's all that needed to be added to put them in, but will
continue to monitor.
Mordred May 6, 2009

All variables I can find that refer to currency has been changed to a long int 
type.  This includes all references to gold, silver, copper, balance, etc where
applicable in mud.h and any affected variables as a result.  It is likely that 
I missed one or several, so we may still get some bug reports about things
not working like they are supposed to at all times with money.
-Mordred June 15, 2009
 
Added an additional check for the buffer length on badge for clans.  May
prevent a memory leak.  
-Mordred August 03, 2009

Fixed do_areas - now using sscanf to handle argument conversion. 
-Mordred August 03, 2009

Changed save_clan function call in pfiles.c - was making the "clan" 
pointer the middle condition of a "for" loop - really should test for
equivalency ==NULL.  Not sure if it made a difference but really clan
by itself would return a 0 not a null - see if it fixed things...
-Mordred August 14, 2009
