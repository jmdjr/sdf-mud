I wish I could remember the format we used to use, it was nice. It doesn't
matter though. Just note the functions and files you edited, and what your
changes did. Comments in the code are always good too.

Added do_trance, ruminate and meditate to skills.c. Also added a ! to do_group 
(act_comm.c) to make it so mana is actually displayed

Fixed mud.h's dice_parse function's parameter name. Was 'exp', now it's 'exp2'.
This should prevent the name comflict with math.h's exp function, or whatever
it was. I still don't know how math.h is bring included.

Fixed skills.c's tumbling function. It now does not call chance to check if
your align agrees with your clan's align.
-Batman November 2, 2008

Finished up on ruminate, trance and meditate in skills.c. Also did what was
needed to add gsns for all of them. I did a tiny change to do_peace in
act_wiz.c, too.
-Andy November 4, 2008

Fixed the sys_bugs argument in do_fshow (act_wiz.c) and added last_bugs 
argument.
-Andy November 5, 2008

Fixed the issue with any class/race being able to Mistwalk.
-Tron November 6, 2008

Fixed fshow helps, and updated fshow clear in the function do_fshow and
do_fclear (both in act_wiz.c) and updated mud.h with a definition for
NOHELP_FILE. Also edited act_info.c so as to log to system/nohelp.txt
when soembody tries to access a non-existant help file.
-Andy November 7, 2008 

Created do_visogy function. The problem with it was, I think, that it was 
a skill, and the code was set up to treat it as a spell. Files edited: 
do.c, skills.c
-Andy November 8, 2008

Fixed a Memory leak with clean_obj_queue. It was supposed to clean up 
the memory of an extracted object.
-Tron November 9th, 2008

Uncommented four lines in update.  related to bloodthirst.  
I'm not sure why they were commented out in the first place, but it
is part of the function that magic.c (gain_condition) to update blood
values, and contains a function that gain_condition is calling to perform
a full update.  Still trying to trace all the connections to determine 
why a successful (or unsuccessful) spell doesn't alter blood points.
-Mordred November 14, 2008

Commented out a call to nice() in pfiles.c. Would set priority to 20 (lowest) 
when pfiles were scanned.
-Marten November 15th, 2008

Made it so that balzhur, destroy and suicide delete lockers in their 
respective functions.. act_wiz.c, suicide.c
-Andy November 16, 2008

Changed do_meditate in skills.c so that NPCs can't use it. They don't need 
it, and it was crashing the MDU.
-Andy November 17, 2008

Fixed do_loadup in act_wiz.c so that the MUD doesn't crash when you loadup a
non-existant character.
-Andy November 18, 2008

Fixed the blood problem (not losing it), function gain_condition in 
update.c
-Reaper November 18, 2008

Changed recall to only work for levels 0-25 and >= 100 skils.c 
function do_recall
-Andy November 18, 2008

Commented out everywhere that made you bleed... Just grep for COND_BLEEDING
and gain_condition. You'll see where the changes were.
-Andy December 7, 2008
