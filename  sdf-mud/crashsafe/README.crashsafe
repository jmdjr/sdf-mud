This code is made to recover your MUD from a recent crash.  What you need
to do to activate crashsafe is simply place a recent copy of your rmexe
(executable file) in this directory and activate the program crashsafe via
cset on the MUD.

This should be all, we also recommend you place copies of your Makefile
and rmstart files in this directory incase you accidently purge them and
need a copy.
