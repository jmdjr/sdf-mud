/*

You need to define:

COPYOVER_FILE - temporary data file used
EXE_FILE      - file to be exec'ed (i.e. the MUD)


Note that I advance level 1 chars to level 2 - this is necessary in MERC and
Envy, but I think that ROM saves level 1 characters too.

Note that you might want to change your close_socket() a bit. I have changed
the connected state so that negative states represent logging-in, while as
positive ones represent states where the character is already inside the game.
close_socket() frees that chararacters with negative state, but just loses
link on those with a positive state. I believe that idea comes from Elwyn
originally.

Things to note: This corresponds to a reboot, followed by the characters
logging in again. This means that stuff like corpses, disarmed weapons etc.
are lost, unless you save those to the pfile. You should probably give the
players some warning before doing a copyover.

The command was inspired by the discussion on merc-l about how Fusion's MUD++
could reboot without players having to re-login :)
